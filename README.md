# satellite-chassis
Fusion 360 files (.f3d) for the satellite chassis.

You can download and view the .f3d files separately, or view the whole design via "pääprojekti vXX". You must download all of the .f3d files for this to work. You must also download the PCB file [from here](https://www.cansat.fi/assets/files/cansat-97dd24a7e809746772f94e56cb13d5b6.step).

The design is made for 3D-printing (apart from the PCB). It is not final.
